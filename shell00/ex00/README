Exercise 00 
Delivery Directory: ex00/
Files to deliver: z 
Authorized functions: None
---------------------------
Create a file named `z` that, when a `cat` command is executed on it, displays "Z" followed by a newline.
?>cat z 
Z
?>
---------------------------
Inside the shell00 directory, we should create a subdirectory named ex00:
mkdir ex00 
cd ex00

Using the `mkdir` command, we create the directory, and with the `cd` command, we change directory.

Later on, we need to create the requested file named z, written in lowercase. 
You can use either nano or vim for this task; the choice is up to you. 
Inside the z file, you need to write the capital letter Z.

Steps for vim execution:
------------------------
1. Create and open the z file with vim:
vim z
2. Insert mode: i
2. Write the capital letter Z in the file.
3. Save and close the file in vim:
Esc:wq 

This command allows you to save and close the file in `vim`.
