Exercise 00 
Delivery Directory: ex00/
Files to deliver: z 
Authorized functions: None
---------------------------

To complete this exercise, the first thing you need to do is create the delivery directory within a folder called shell00, just like you see it here: 

mkdir shell00 
cd shell00 

Inside the shell00 directory, we should create a subdirectory named ex00:

mkdir ex00 
cd ex00

Using the `mkdir` command, we create the directory, and with the `cd` command, we change directory.

Later on, we need to create the requested file named z, written in lowercase. You can use either nano or vim for this task; the choice is up to you. 
Inside the z file, you need to write the capital letter Z.

Steps for vim execution:

1. Create and open the z file with vim:
vim z

2. Write the capital letter Z in the file.
3. Save and close the file in vim:
Press Esc
Type: :wq 

This command allows you to save and close the file in `vim`.
