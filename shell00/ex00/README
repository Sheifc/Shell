Exercise 00 
Delivery Directory: ex00/
Files to deliver: z 
Authorized functions: None
---------------------------

To complete this exercise, the first thing we need to do is create the delivery directory within a folder called shell00: 
mkdir shell00 
cd shell00 
mkdir ex00 
cd ex00. 

Using the `mkdir` command, we create the directory, and with the `cd` command, we change directory.

Later on, we need to create the file requested named `z` written in lowercase for which you can use `nano` or `vim`, the choice is up to you and in the file you need to write the capital letter `Z`.

Steps for vim execution:
vim z
Z
command: esc:wq 

This command allows you to save and close the file in vim.
