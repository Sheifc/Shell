SSH Key

Delivery directory: ex03/ 
Files to deliver: id_rsa_pub 
Authorized functions: None
--------------------------------

• Create your own SSH key. Once you have it:
- Add your public key to your repository, in a file named id_rsa_pub
- Update your SSH key on the intranet. This will allow you to push the repository to our git server.
The file name has not been chosen randomly.
Make sure you understand the difference between public key and private key.
---------------------------------

ssh -keygen
enter (several times)
cd ~/.ssh 
# To add ~ Alt or option ñ
# From here on, you can use it to consult the key.
ls 
# `ls` lists three files for us, the ".pub" is our public key, we open it using `cat`:
cat id_rsa.pub

NOTE: It displays the key that we copy and paste into our SSH Key settings on the intranet. 
We return to the terminal and upload the repository using Git. 
Previously, we didn't have permission because we hadn't set up the SSH key.

Git instructions: 
----------------
git init
git status
git add . (if you don´t wish to add all files, you can select the files to add instead of using `.`)
git commit -m "comment" (-m allows you to add a comment)
git push 
git log (allows you to check that has been pushed correctly)
