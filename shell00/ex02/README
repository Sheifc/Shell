Authorized functions: None
---------------------------

cd ex02

â€¢ Once the exercise is solved, execute the command `tar -cf exo2.tar *` to create the file that you'll need to submit. 
%> ls -l
total XX
drwx--xr-x 2 XX XX XX Jun 1 20:47 test0 
-rwx--xr--1 XX XX 4 Jun 1 21:46 test1
dr-x---r-- 2 XX XX XX Jun 1 22:45 test2 
-r-----r--2 XX XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test3
-rw-r----x 1 XX XX 2 Jun 1 23:43 test4 
-r-----r-- 2 XX XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test5
lrwxrwxrwx 1 XX XX 5 Jun 1 22:20 test6 -> test0 
%>

A year is accepted as an answer instead of the time.
