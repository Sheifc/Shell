Exercise 02
Delivery Directory: ex02/
Files to deliver: exo2.tar 
Authorized functions: None
---------------------------

Create a folder inside the directory shell00 named ex01 and change directory: 
mkdir ex02
cd ex02

Create the following files and directories. Do whatever is necessary so that running an `ls -l` in your directory shows something resembling this:
â€¢ Once the exercise is solved, execute the command `tar -cf exo2.tar *` to create the file that you'll need to submit. 
%> ls -l
total XX
drwx--xr-x 2 XX XX XX Jun 1 20:47 test0 
-rwx--xr-- 1 XX XX 4 Jun 1 21:46 test1
dr-x---r-- 2 XX XX XX Jun 1 22:45 test2 
-r-----r-- 2 XX XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test3
-rw-r----x 1 XX XX 2 Jun 1 23:43 test4 
-r-----r-- 2 XX XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test5
lrwxrwxrwx 1 XX XX 5 Jun 1 22:20 test6 -> test0 
%>

Don't worry about what appears in place of "XX". 

A year is accepted as an answer instead of the time.

- Create the file `exo2` in your delivery directory.

- To create a file that occupies one bit, you choose a text editor like, for example, nano. 
Upon opening the file, you write a character and then delete it in a way that the newline will count as 1 bit. 
Otherwise, if you don't write anything in the file, it would weigh 0.

- Save and close nano: 
control o
Enter
control x

- In this exercise, you are being asked to create a link from `test6` to `test0`. 
To create the link, we use the following command: 

ln -s test0 test6

where: 
`ln` creates a new directory entry (linked file) that has the same permissions as the original files 
`-s` allows us to create a symbolic link 

- Note that the files `test3` and `test5` are exact copies; that's why we need to create the `test5` file based on `test3` like this: `ln test3 test5`. 
This way, we observe that both of them contain 2 links instead of 1. 

- We change the dates of files and directories using: 
touch -t

For links: 
touch -mht

where `-m` means modification, `h` for link, and `t` for time.

- To change permissions: (For more information, refer to the file permissions in the `ex01` folder)
chmod 715 test0
chmod 714 test1
chmod 504 test2
chmod 404 test3 (this will automatically change test5 too)
chmod 641 test4

To change permissions of links: 
chmod -h 777 test6
Where -h is related to links

- To compress the file in .tar format: 
tar -cf exo2.tar

- To evaluate this exercise you need to decompress the file, for this you can use this command: 
tar -xf exo2.tar

Or you can open the folder on terminal: open . 
And then double click
