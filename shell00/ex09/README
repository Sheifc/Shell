Files to deliver: ft_magic
Delivery directory: ex09/ 
Authorized functions: None
--------------------------

â€¢ Create a magic file named 'ft_magic' that must be correctly formatted to detect files of type 42 using the 'file' command, 
consisting of the string "42" at the 42nd byte.

man file
--------------------------

Create a folder inside the directory shell00 named ex09 and change directory: 
mkdir ex09
cd ex09
---------------------------

WARNING: Only the file ft_magic should be deliver, the rest of files must be deleted, they only have been included here to show to check how the command works. 

---------------------------

Steps: 
------
vim ft_magic
i
41 string 42 42 file
esc:wq
-------

`41 string 42` : is indicating that the file contains 41 bits and on 42 bit is written the string 42
`42 file`: is the name shown on screen to identify the file 

To check how this command works: 

1. Create a file which contains on the 42 bit the number 42 written: we call the file for example: test
2. Enter this command on terminal:
file -m ft_magic test
3. You should be on terminal the file `test` with the name changed to `42`. 

Using this command you can find files with a specific detail inside (like 42 on bit 42) that can be used to localise it
and be exposed with a selected name to be found (like 42).
