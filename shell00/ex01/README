Exercise 01
Delivery Directory: ex01/
Files to deliver: testShell00.tar 
Authorized functions: None
---------------------------

Create a folder inside the directory shell00 named ex01 and change directory: 
mkdir ex01
cd ex01

Create the file `testShell00` in your delivery directory.
• Find a way for your screen to display the following (except for the "total 1" line):
%> ls -l
total XX
-r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00
%>
• Once the previous steps are completed, execute the following command to create the file that must be submitted: `tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00`.

- To complete this exercise, we create and open the file testShell00:
nano testShell00

- Write 39 characters in the file, which results in a size of 40 bits due to the newline also being counted.

- Save and close: 
Control o 
Enter
Control x

- Modify time and date: 
touch -t 202306012342 testShell00

- Modify the permissions to obtain: -r--r-xr-x
chmod 455 testShell00

- Compress the file in .tar format.
tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00
