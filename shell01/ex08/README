-------------------------------
• Write a command line that retrieves the numbers included in the variables FT_NBR1 in base '\\"?! and FT_NBR2 in base mrdoc, and displays the sum of the two in base gtaio luSnemf.
◦ Example 1:
FT_NBR1=\'?"\"'\
FT_NBR2=rcrdmddd
◦ The sum is: 
Salut
◦ Example 2:
FT_NBR1=\"\"!\"\"!\"\"!\"\"!\"\"!\"\"
FT_NBR2=dcrcmcmooododmrrrmorcmcrmomo
◦ The sum is:
Segmentation fault
--------------------------------
echo $FT_NBR1 + $FT_NBR2 | tr "'"'\\\"\?\!' 01234 | tr 'mrdoc' 01234 | sed 's/^/obase=13; ibase=5;/' | bc | tr 0123456789ABC 'gtaio luSnemf'

The entire command sequence takes FT_NBR1 and FT_NBR2, performs base conversions and arithmetic, and then translates the result into the specified character set.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. `echo $FT_NBR1 + $FT_NBR2`: This part of the command takes two variables, `$FT_NBR1` and `$FT_NBR2`, and prints them to the standard output with a plus sign between them.
   
2. `tr "'"'\\\"\?\!' 01234`: Here, the `tr` (translate) command is used to replace certain characters in the input. 
The characters in the string `"'"'\\"?!'` will be replaced with digits from 0 to 4, respectively. 
For instance, `'` is replaced by `0`, `"` by `1`, `\` by `2`, `?` by `3`, and `!` by `4`.

3. `tr 'mrdoc' 01234`: This part of the command performs another translation with `tr`. 
The characters in the string `'mrdoc'` will be replaced with digits from 0 to 4, respectively. 
Therefore, `m` is replaced by `0`, `r` by `1`, `d` by `2`, `o` by `3`, and `c` by `4`.

4. `sed 's/^/obase=13; ibase=5;/'`: Here, the `sed` command is used to add `"obase=13; ibase=5;"` to the beginning of each line. 
This sets the numeric conversion base to 13 in the output and 5 in the input, meaning that numbers will be interpreted and displayed in base 5 and 13, respectively.

5. `bc`: After the previous transformations, the resulting string is passed to the `bc` program, which is an arbitrary-precision calculator. 
The `bc` command performs mathematical calculations based on the bases set in the previous step.

6. `tr 0123456789ABC 'gtaio luSnemf'`: Finally, the result obtained from `bc` is passed to another translation using `tr`. 
Digits from 0 to 9 and the letters `A`, `B`, and `C` will be replaced according to the replacement string `'gtaio luSnemf'`.

The final outcome of this entire process is a transformed and encrypted string that uses character replacements and numeric base conversions to achieve a specific result.

To test the command: 
-------------------
1. Grant permissions: 
chmod 744 add_chelou.sh

2. Then run this command on terminal: 
FT_NBR1='\'"'"'?"\"'"'"'\' FT_NBR2=rcrdmddd ./add_chelou.sh

Output: 
------
Salut
