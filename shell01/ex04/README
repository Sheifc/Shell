--------------------------
â€¢ Write a command line that displays the MAC addresses of your computer. Each address will be followed by a newline.

man ifconfig
--------------------------

When you use the 'ifconfig' command in the terminal, a lot of information appears. In this information, 
we see that MAC addresses are preceded by the word 'ether'. 
Therefore, we can search for the word 'ether' using 'sed' and replace each line from the beginning using '^' 
and any intermediate text '.*' until the word 'ether' and the following space.
