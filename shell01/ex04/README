Exercise 04: MAC.sh

Files to deliver: MAC.sh
Authorized functions: None
--------------------------
â€¢ Write a command line that displays the MAC addresses of your computer. Each address will be followed by a newline.

man ifconfig

WARNING: only MAC.sh can be delivered. The other files are only provided to check how the command works. 
--------------------------
ifconfig | grep -w ether | sed 's/^.*ether //' | tr -d ' '

When you use the 'ifconfig' command in the terminal, a lot of information appears. 
In this information, we see that MAC addresses are preceded by the word 'ether'. 

Therefore, we can search for the word 'ether' using grep -w and replace each line from the beginning using 'sed' and '^' 
and any intermediate text '.*' until the word 'ether' and the following space.

tr -d ' ' : to delete the newline
