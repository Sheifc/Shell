Exercise 02: find_sh.sh
Delivery directory: ex02/ 
Files to deliver: find_sh.sh 
Authorized functions: None
----------------------------
• Write a command line that searches in the current directory and all its subdirectories for all files whose names end with ".sh" (without the quotes) 
and only displays their names without the .sh extension.
• Example output:

$>./find_sh.sh | cat -e
find_sh$
file1$
file2$
file3$
$>

Don't trust any source of information: Always conduct your own tests, checks, and verifications.
----------------------------

find . -name '*.sh' -type f -exec basename {} \; | sed 's/\.sh//g'

find . : find in current directory and subdirectories
-name '*.sh': names that start with whatever (*) and finish with .sh
-type f: files
-exec basename {} \; The `basename` command is executed, passing the found file {} as a parameter. 
`basename` returns the file name and removes the path.
\; is needed for -exec to work 
sed 's/\.sh//g' : sed is used to replace multiple characters, on this ocassion, replace `.sh` for nothing
`\` is used to escape special characters, on this ocassion to escape the character `.`
`g` can be used or not, returns the same solution

Make the file executable by providing it with the appropriate permissions:
chmod 744 find_sh.sh
