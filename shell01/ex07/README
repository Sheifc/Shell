Exercise 07: r_dwssap.sh
Delivery directory: ex07/ 
Files to deliver: r_dwssap.sh 
Authorized functions: None
-----------------------------
• Write a command line that displays the result of the command 'cat /etc/passwd', removing comments, 
showing every second line starting from the second, reversing each username, sorting them in reverse alphabetical order, 
keeping only the usernames between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2 (both inclusive), separated by ", " (without the quotes), and ending with a ".".
• Example: Between lines 7 and 15, the result will be something like this:

$> ./r_dwssap.sh
sstq_, sorebrek_brk_, soibten_, sergtsop_, scodved_, rlaxcm_, rgmecived_, revreswodniw_, revressta_
.$>

Follow the instructions in the statement rigorously.
-----------------------------
cat /etc/passwd |
grep --invert-match '^#' |
sed -n "n;p" |
sed 's/\:.*//g' |
rev | 
sort -r |
awk -v var1=$FT_LINE1 -v var2=$FT_LINE2 'NR>=var1 && NR<=var2 { print }' | 
paste -sd "," - | 
sed 's/,/, /g' | 
sed 's/$/./g' |
tr -d '\n'

`cat /etc/passwd`: reads and displays the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file
`grep --invert-match '^#'` : excludes lines starting with '#' (comments) from the outputremoves the comments. 
It means, it is deselected all starting from the beginning to #
`sed -n "n;p"` : -n modifes the default output, n jumps the line and p prints, resulting in printing from the second line
`sed 's/\:.*//g'` : removes everything after the first colon (':') in each line (typically used to extract usernames from `/etc/passwd`)
`rev`: reverses the characters in each line of the input. It flips the text from left to right
`sort -r` : sorts the lines in reverse order (alphabetically from Z to A)
`awk -v var1=$FT_LINE1 -v var2=$FT_LINE2 'NR>=var1 && NR<=var2 { print }'`: selects lines between line numbers specified by `FT_LINE1` and `FT_LINE2` variables.
`paste -sd "," -`: combines lines with a comma (,) separator
`sed 's/,/, /g'`: adds a space after each comma
`sed 's/$/./g'` : adds a period (.) at the end of the line. $ means last character
`tr -d '\n'` : removes newline characters, ensuring the output is in a single line

To check these commands: 
-----------------------
1. Make the file executable by providing it with the appropriate permissions:
chmod 744 r_dwssap.sh
2. Then:
export FT_LINE1=7
export FT_LINE2=15
