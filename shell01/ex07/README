-----------------------------
• Write a command line that displays the result of the command 'cat /etc/passwd', removing comments, 
showing every second line starting from the second, reversing each username, sorting them in reverse alphabetical order, 
keeping only the usernames between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2 (both inclusive), separated by ", " (without the quotes), and ending with a ".".
• Example: Between lines 7 and 15, the result will be something like this:

$> ./r_dwssap.sh
sstq_, sorebrek_brk_, soibten_, sergtsop_, scodved_, rlaxcm_, rgmecived_, revreswodniw_, revressta_
.$>

Follow the instructions in the statement rigorously.
