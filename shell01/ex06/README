--------------------------
â€¢ Write a command line that displays an 'ls -l' every two lines, starting from the first.
--------------------------
It means to display one line yes, another no.

ls -l | sed -n 'p;n'

sed -n : modifies the output that usually appears by default
'p;n' : p print, n jump: therefore prints the first line, jumps the second and so on.
